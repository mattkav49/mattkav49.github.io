Hello everyone! My name is Matt Kavanaugh, and I am a first-year master's student
in the agricultural meteorology program at Iowa State University. I conduct
research on remote sensing and specifically how it is being used to measure soil
moisture in agricultural regions, particularly in the Midwestern USA. R is not my
primary programming language, however I do use it periodically for statistical
analysis of my datasets. It is very convenient and fun to use for the most part.
My favorite package that we have discussed thus far is tabulizer. It is so cool
that this package is able to convert data from PDFs into .csv or other data file
types. I plan to use it more frequently going forward in this class and beyond.
